## Hi there 👋

I am a senior at St. Lawrence University majoring in Psychology and Statistics. :brain: 

I've worked on three research projects at St. Lawrence including making sport related education modules for the SCORE Network,
a shiny app that visualizes mental health data, and I'm currently working on a research project that invesitgates how chewing gum affects motor performance.
